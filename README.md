# Python Random Translator

The purpose of this script is for a user to insert a word and a number. This script will translate the phrase the number of times specified to random languages then finally back to English. It achieves this task by utilizing the Google translate API.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

Python 3 Installed on Windows, Mac, or Linux.

### Installation

Use the following command in the working directory to install the libraries necessary to run the script.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the script

For Windows:
```
python rand_translate.py
```
For Mac and Linux:

## Extra Notes

There is a limit for the number of requests per day. If you get a random error then it probably means you have reached the daily limit. Either wait 24 hours or use a VPN/Proxy server to bypass it.
